<MobileIntegrationAbout/>

Currently, Hanko doesn't provide native mobile SDKs like the [web components](/quickstarts/frontend). This guide shows how to integrate Hanko authentication into your native mobile app using direct API calls.

<Note>
  This guide focuses on the passwordless flow, so passwords will be ignored.
</Note>

<Note>Passkeys are only supported on iOS 16+ and Android 9+.</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Check if the user exists">

After an email input was shown and the user provided their email, you should check if the user already exists.
You can do that by using the [Get user details by email](/api-reference/public/user-management/get-user-details-by-email) endpoint.

You will either get an HTTP status code of `200` or `404`. If you get `200`, remember the `id` returned in the response object and go to step 'Send a passcode'.
If you get `404`, go to the next step.

</Step>

<Step title="Create user">

When the user does not already exist, you will need to create the user before you can verify the email. The user can be created using the [Create a user](/api-reference/public/user-management/create-a-user) endpoint.

You will either get an HTTP status code of `200` or `409`. If you get `409`, then the user already exists, and you can obtain the users `id` from the success response of the endpoint mentioned in the previous step.
If you get `200`, remember the `id` returned in the response object.

</Step>

<Step title="Send a passcode">
To verify an email address or to log in the user, you need to send a passcode to the provided email address and verify that the user has access to it. To send a passcode just use the [Initialize passcode login](/api-reference/public/passcode/initialize-passcode-login) endpoint.
You need to provide the user's `id` you obtained in one of the previous steps. If sending the passcode was successful, you will get an `id` for the passcode in the response object. Remember this `id`, because you will need it to finalize the passcode flow.

When the user entered the passcode, send it together with the passcode `id` from the [Init endpoint](/api-reference/public/passcode/initialize-passcode-login) to the [Finalize passcode login](/api-reference/public/passcode/finalize-passcode-login) endpoint.
When the passcode is correct you will get a JWT either as a cookie or in the `X-Auth-Token` header (depends on the configuration of the Hanko backend) .

The user is now logged in. To verify (in your backend) that the JWT is valid, see our [Backend guide](/quickstarts/backend).

Optionally you can offer the user to register a passkey now, enabling a faster login flow the next time. See the next step on how to do it.

</Step>

<Step title="Create a passkey (optional)">

To create a passkey you will need to use the native APIs that [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/fido/android/native-apps)
and [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationplatformpublickeycredentialprovider)
provide for their platforms. Find out how to use them [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/public-private_key_authentication/supporting_passkeys)
(Apple) and [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/fido2-for-android#0) (Android).

For both you will need `PublicKeyCredentialAttestationOptions` which you can get from the [Initialize WebAuthn registration](/api-reference/public/webauthn/initialize-webauthn-registration) endpoint.

After the native system APIs were called with the options you will receive a `PublicKeyCredentialAttestationResponse`. Send the response to the [Finalize WebAuthn registration](/api-reference/public/webauthn/finalize-webauthn-registration) endpoint.
If successful, the user can use the created passkey to login faster the next time.

<Note>

The two endpoints ([Initialize WebAuthn registration](/api-reference/public/webauthn/initialize-webauthn-registration) and [Finalize WebAuthn registration](/api-reference/public/webauthn/finalize-webauthn-registration)) mentioned above can only be called with a valid JWT.

</Note>

<Note>

In order for **Android** to work with the [Hanko backend](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko) you will need to add an "APK Key Hash" to either `webauthn.relying_party.origins` or in the advanced page in the settings at [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io).
Use this command to create the "APK Key Hash":

```shell
echo 'android:apk-key-hash:'"$(keytool -exportcert -alias key-name -keystore path-to-keystore | openssl sha256 -binary | openssl base64 | tr -- '+/' '-_' | tr -d '=')"
```

Change `-alias` and `-keystore` flag values to your personal values.

</Note>

</Step>
<Step title="Login with a passkey (optional)">

In order to use a passkey for login, add a button ("Sign in with a passkey") under your email input. After interaction with the button, call the native APIs that [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/fido/android/native-apps)
and [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationplatformpublickeycredentialprovider).
Find out how to use them [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/public-private_key_authentication/supporting_passkeys)
(Apple) and [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/fido2-for-android#0) (Android).

For both you will need `PublicKeyCredentialAssertionOptions` which you can get from the [Initialize WebAuthn login](/api-reference/public/webauthn/initialize-webauthn-login) endpoint.

After the native system APIs were called with the options you will receive a `PublicKeyCredentialAssertionResponse`. Send the response to the [Finalize WebAuthn login](/api-reference/public/webauthn/finalize-webauthn-login) endpoint.
If successful you will get back a JWT either as a cookie or in the `X-Auth-Token` header (depends on the configuration of the Hanko backend).

The user is now logged in. To verify (in your backend) that the JWT is valid, see our [Backend guide](/quickstarts/backend).
