# Hanko Authorization Guide

**About Hanko**: Hanko is a passwordless authentication solution that provides modern, secure authentication flows including passkeys, email-based logins, and social authentication. It offers both hosted (Hanko Cloud) and self-hosted options, with comprehensive SDKs for seamless integration.

**What This Guide Covers**: This guide demonstrates how to add a comprehensive authorization layer on top of your Hanko authentication using Permit.io. You'll learn to implement role-based access control (RBAC) and policy-based authorization to manage user permissions effectively.

**Key Technologies**: 
- Hanko Elements (Web Components)
- Permit.io (Authorization Platform)
- Next.js (React Framework)
- TypeScript
- JWT Token Validation
- Policy Decision Points (PDP)

**Prerequisites**: 
- Basic knowledge of React/Next.js
- Understanding of authentication vs authorization concepts
- Node.js development environment
- Active Hanko project configured
- Permit.io account setup

**Tasks You'll Complete**:
1. Set up Permit.io integration with Hanko
2. Configure user roles and permissions
3. Implement authorization checks in your application
4. Sync user data between Hanko and Permit.io
5. Test role-based access control
6. Handle authorization errors and edge cases
